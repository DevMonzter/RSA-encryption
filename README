When run, this Java console application generates a pseudo random number, then encrypts and decrypts the numeric value, using the RSA algorithm. No external data files are needed to run the program.

----

The program generates two prime numbers, p and q, that are between the range of 2^64 and 2^256.

Next, variables of the RSA algorithm are derived:

n = p*q
m = (p-1)(q-1)
e = I used the large prime number 65537 for this implementation. e is coprime to m.
d is derived from: 1 = de mod n

These values give us our Public Key, (e, n), and Private Key (d, n).

Lastly, the actual encryption and decryption are performed on the plaintext value, pseudo random number.
